# cc-database-basics

This workshop will focus on introducing basic database design concepts and provide hands-on practice with using Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, manage content of, and extract inforamtion from databases. We recommend you install Jupyter notebook and the current version of python 3 (3.8 in February 2021) through the Anaconda Individual Edition download and installation as it provides a complete set of tools for running and managing a scientific python work environment on your system.
