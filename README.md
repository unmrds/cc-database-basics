# cc-database-basics

This workshop will focus on introducing basic database design concepts and provide hands-on practice with using Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, manage content of, and extract information from databases. This workshop will use the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org) - [Data Management with SQL for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/) lesson for both the conceptual overview and hands-on practice. __While the lesson uses ecological data for the hands-on practice, the skills and knowledge gained from the workshop are fully transferable to other disciplinary contexts.__ 

You can prepare for the workshop by following the [setup instructions](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/setup.html) provided as part of the lesson materials.
